## 🧭 Development Direction — Toward v2.0.0

**For updates leading up to version 2.0.0**, I’ll be reviewing and removing a lot of content from the client pack.

Over time, I started treating it as my personal pack and added a bit of everything, which hurt performance and **was never the goal**.

This pack was originally meant for purists — much like the *Hermitcraft* style — focusing on **small client-side tweaks and tools**.  
The main content has always been intended to live on the [**server**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fantazs-barely-modded-server), which is where my focus will be moving forward.

---

### 🎨 Changes to Expect
- Removal of **resource packs** and other **visual or aesthetic mods**  
- A return to the pack’s **original lightweight vision**  
- Improved **performance and stability**

If you’d like to use this pack as a starting point and **build on it with your own visuals or preferences**, you’re more than welcome to.
