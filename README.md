<summary>Server Installation</summary>

Modpack is available on Modrinth, but can be easily installed on any hosting service that supports custom jars. Naturally it can also be installed on Modrinth Servers using it's built-in modpack installer

### Provided installer (Recommended)

Every release of a modpack provides extra file named `server.jar`. Just download it and run it like any other Minecraft server ([see MC wiki for running it locally](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Setting_up_a_server), or follow your server hosting tutorial about using custom jars). Only thing you will need to do is to accept Minecraft's eula.

### Using mrpack4server

You can use [mrpack4server](https://github.com/Patbox/mrpack4server) just as it's described in it's readme. Officially provided `server.jar` uses pre-configured version of it set to download the pack, so there should be no functionality difference aside of having to set it up manually.

### Other methods

Other known methods of installing modrinth modpacks include [mrpack-installer](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install), [itzg/minecraft-server docker image](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or any other compatible installer, though I wouldn't suggest using them for non-technical users.
