## Datapack / Spyglass Configuration

A custom datapack applies gamerules on world load.
One of these gamerules is non-vanilla.

To keep Spyglass validation clean:
- `commands.json` is generated via [Command Extractor](https://modrinth.com/mod/command_extractor)
- Spyglass is configured to reference it

This setup is required for proper command validation and is intentional.
